The conntrack-tools are a set of free software userspace tools for Linux that allow system administrators interact with the Connection Tracking System, which is the module that provides stateful packet inspection for iptables. The conntrack-tools are the userspace daemon conntrackd and the command line interface conntrack.

The userspace daemon conntrackd can be used to enable high availability of cluster-based stateful firewalls and to collect statistics of the stateful firewall use

Kubernetes auditing provides a security-relevant chronological set of records documenting the sequence of activities that have affected system by individual users, administrators or other components of the system. It allows cluster administrator to answer the following questions:

    what happened?
    when did it happen?
    who initiated it?
    on what did it happen?
    where was it observed?
    from where was it initiated?
    to where was it going?
